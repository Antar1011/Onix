# Development Roadmap

This document lays out my plans for the development of Onix. It is far from set
in stone (which is why I'm putting it in GitHub as opposed to the blog), but it
will be a useful resource for me to keep myself on track towards a clear
end-goal. To that end, before laying out the roadmap itself, I'm starting with
the "destination," the state I envision for Onix in its "1.0" release. Only
after the description of this "final" state do I proceed to lay out how I plan
on getting there.

## 1.0
At this point, Onix will be considered fully usable, and a system built on Onix
will officially replace the
[Smogon-Usage-Stats](https://github.com/Antar1011/Smogon-Usage-Stats) scripts in
 "production." This release must meet the following requirements:
  - Replicates or replaces the full suite of analyses present in the existing
  Smogon Usage Stats, namely:
    - Usage statistics / rankings
    - Detailed moveset statistics
        - Including checks / counters and teammate stats
    - Metagame analyses
    - Lead Stats
    - Detailed monotype statistics
  - Supports the following new analyses, not present in the current Smogon
  Usage Stats suite
    - Lead and check / counter stats for Doubles / Triples tiers
    - Support for non-standard metagames
        - Previous generations
        - Seasonal tiers
    - Move usage statistics
  - Supports updating and re-analyzing historical data (_e.g._ new team type)
  without havign to go back to the logs
  - Supports a public API for deep queries (_e.g._ "What fraction of Serperior
  with ability Contrary run Leaf Storm?" and "What's the most common Pokemon on
  teams with both Landorus and Charizard-Mega-X?")
  - Supports researcher access to anonymized data sources (that is, backed by
  a database that provides fine-grain access control)
  - Performance-optimized
  - Handles errors in an intelligent way (_e.g._ species not found in Pokedex?
  Try updating the Pokedex!)
  - Deploys in "production" environment (might share a server with Pokemon
  Showdown or Smogon or might be hosted on a separate server or AWS)
    - Installable via pip, possibly with non-Python dependences (_e.g._ node.js,
    a postgresql server or, well, pip, but not anaconda)
    - Works with system-default Python 2 or 3 (newer Ubuntus)
        - PyPy would be nice

## Intermediate Milestones

### 0.1
"Proof of Concept" release with a complete functioning pipeline from logs to
stat reports for the most essential of analyses. This release must meet the
following requirements: 
  - Can produce usage statistics / rankings report for all non-mod tiers (so,
  yes Hackmons, no Gen V UU)
  - Collection system supports extraction of movesets and battle info
    - Processing the turn-by-turn battle logs not required at this point
  - Must work on Python 2.7, 3.5 (PyPy not required)
      
### 0.2
This release will build out more of the reporting infrastructure in a robust
way, potentially making use of concurrency. It must meet the following
requirements:
  - Can produce detiled moveset statistics, _sans_ checks & counters and
  anything that requires "enrichment" (_e.g._ stalliness metrics)
  - Reporting system can handle producing multiple reports simultaenously
    - If the database is Sqlite, will have to research whether it supports
    concurrent access. If it doesn't, the database will have to be sharded.
    
### 0.3
This release focuses on processing the turn-by-turn battle logs, which is going
to be a huge project. The release must meet the following requirements:
  - Collection system supports processing of turn-by-turn battle logs
    - Must include doubles / triples as well as singles
    - Don't need to be in the same DB infrastructure as the rest of the system
    (that is, no requirement for JSON storage in SQLite)
  - The first "enrichment" processes will be in this release to support the
  following analyses using data taken from the turn-by-turn logs:
    - Lead statistics (for doubles / triples as well as singles)
    - "Turn out" statistics (avg. # of turns on the field per Pokemon or
    moveset)

### 0.4
"MVP" release, which builds "enrichment" processes to allow for the production
of all reports generated by the current Smogon Usage Stats suite. This release
must meet the following requirements:
  - Supports the following additional analyses:
    - Checks & Counters statistics (Singles only)
    - Teammate statistics
    - Stalliness analysis
    - Team tagging / metagame analysis
    - "Viability ceiling" metric
  - Easily deployable on Pokemon Showdown server
    - This could require installing miniconda and running in a virtual
    environment
    - Really, the focus here is no conflict with existing infrastrucute (_e.g._
    Onix doesn't require a DB that conflicts with PS' DBs)
      - But again, this should be the advantage of using virtual environments
  - Stable enough to get through a full month of logs (with "problematic" 
  metagames skipped)
  - Performance target (setting the bar really low):
    - 10 days to process 30 days of logs (collection)
    - 5 days to enrich and produce reports
