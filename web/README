This is an example of a way to use the new team analyzer. You'll need access to a web serverthat's configured to run Python scripts through cgi. I'm not going to give you instructions for that--Google it.

One you've got your web server properly configured, place TeamAnalyzerWeb.py in the appropriate cgi-bin folder along with symbolic links to baseStats.json and TA.py (or you could just copy those two files to cgi-bin, but then you have to remember to copy over new versions whenever you make or pull changes to TA.py). Once that's done, place TA.html in your www folder and go to it in your browser (e.g. if you're running a local webserver and placed TA.html in the root folder, it'd be http://localhost/TA.html). Paste in your PO/PS team export, hit submit, and watch the magic.
