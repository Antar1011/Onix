Welcome to Onix's documentation!
================================

Onix is a data mining package designed to process
`Pokemon Showdown <http://www.pokemonshowdown.com>`_ battle logs for
`Smogon University <http://www.smogon.com>`_.

It is intended to be stable, robust, easy to maintain and able to support a wide
variety of in-depth analyses. If you're interested in contributing, please check
out our `GitHub repository] <https://github.com/Antar1011/Onix>`_ or contact
Antar through the
`Smogon forums <http://www.smogon.com/forums/members/antar.45129/>`_.

If you're interested in deploying Onix on your own Showdown server contact
`Antar <http://www.smogon.com/forums/members/antar.45129/>`_ for installation
help and usage examples, but be aware that Onix is under active development.
